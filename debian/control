 target.
 .
 detect-new-ip6: detect new ip6 devices which join the network.
 .
 dnsdict6: parallized dns ipv6 dictionary bruteforcer.
 .
 dos-new-ip6: detect new ip6 devices and tell them that their chosen
 IP collides on the network (DOS).
 .
 exploit6: test known ipv6 vulnerabilities against a target.
 .
 fake_mld6: announce yourself in a multicast group of your choice on
 the net.
 .
 fake_router6: announce yourself as a router on the network.
 .
 flood_advertise6: flood a target with random neighbor advertisements.

 .
 redir6: redirect traffic to you intelligently (man-in-the-middle)
 with a clever icmp6 redirect spoofer.
 .
